Status 
- As of 3/24/2022, currently able to parse the etd-naf xml document and store the names and URIs of all committee 
members in a dictionary. Currently working on setting up the actual recon service with OpenRefine. Using a lot
from the LoCreconcile repository, main thing that will differ is the search functionality. Will be
searching the dictionary returned by an object from MADsParser. Names are values in the dict, will scan 
over all the values, possible duplicate URIs will be returned, but that will be handled by the user. i.e. 
they will choose the best match. 

Possible Changes / Potential Improvements
- Was considering storing all the names & URIs in an sqlite3 database, but would impede on search time.
Takes much longer I believe to query a database table than to simply scan over a dictionary. 
O(1) time complexity for lookups. No collisions with URI as the key.
